# Contributing to Tabetalt's BackOffice

:+1::tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing. These are just
guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgment and feel free to
propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Issues and Pull Requests

- If you're not sure about adding something, open an issue to discuss it.
- Feel free to open a Pull Request early so that a discussion can be had as changes are developed.

## Commit Messages and Pull Request Titles

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to standardize our commit history. To enforce this convention on commit messages and/or pull request titles, we use the [Semantic Pull Requests](https://github.com/probot/semantic-pull-requests) bot.

The commit message summary (or pull request title) is constructed by prepending the type of change being made (e.g., feat, fix, refactor), followed by an imperative, present tense sentence (without a period).
Example: `fix: make header bold`.

If you are still working on your pull request, prepend `WIP:` to indicate that it's work in progress.

### Pull Request Title

Same as commit messages, prepend the type of change being made (refactor, fix, chore, feat, etc.)
Example: `docs: add robotic arms`

## Product Development

We use Github issues to track development progress, however product ideas and development are
kept in ProductBoard. You are welcome to [submit ideas and vote on them](https://ideas.tabetalt.no/).

Do you want to contribute with some of the planned or under consideration features, check out
[tabetalt/admin](https://github.com/tabetalt/admin) and see if there is an issue that reference
that feature and let us know.

## Documentation

We strive to have code that is easy to understand, and that code in itself should document our
product as much as possible. However, sometimes that is not enough. We find that guides, tutorials and
specific documentation are the best ones.

Tabetalt has a separate repository that contains documentation related to users and developers.
Check out [docs](https://docs.tabetalt.no/) or [tabetalt/docs](https://github.com/tabetalt/docs) for
more information.

## Community

A communication platform for our community is under construction. Check the progress and share
your feedback / ideas [here](https://github.com/tabetalt/docs/issues/5).

## Need Help?

[open an issue](https://github.com/tabetalt/.github/issues/new)
for help.
